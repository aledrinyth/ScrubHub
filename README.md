Of course! A well-structured and visually appealing `README.md` file is crucial for any project. It's the first thing users will see, so it should clearly explain what your project does and how to use it.

Here is a more presentable and comprehensive version of your `README.md` file, formatted with Markdown.

# üßº ScrubHub: The One-Stop Data Cleaning Solution


ScrubHub is an intelligent, conversational data cleaning agent powered by Streamlit and OpenAI. Simply upload your messy CSV file, and tell ScrubHub what you want to do in plain English. From handling missing values to generating statistical summaries, ScrubHub makes data preprocessing faster and more intuitive than ever.

## Key Features

*   ** Conversational AI**: Interact with your data using natural language. Just ask it to "clean the data" or "show me a summary."
*   ** Smart Analysis**: Automatically analyzes your dataset to suggest cleaning steps and imputation strategies.
*   ** Code Generation**: Generates and executes Python code on the fly to perform cleaning, imputation, and summarization tasks.
*   ** Robust Error Handling**: If the AI-generated code fails, it automatically retries with the error context to self-correct.
*   ** CSV Upload & Download**: Easily upload one or more CSV files and download the cleaned dataset with a single click.
*   ** Data Previews**: Instantly view a preview of your uploaded data to get a quick overview.
